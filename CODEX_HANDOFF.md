# Codex handoff — Wonder

**Product name:** Wonder (formerly Dr. Melani)  
**Repo:** https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/wonder (private)  
**Canonical branch:** `main` (always push here for agent handoffs)  
**Legacy work branch:** `grok/latest-dr-melani-july-21-2026`  
**Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript (not Next.js)  
**Local URL:** http://127.0.0.1:5173/ (Safari)  
**Visibility:** private  
**Date stamp:** 2026-07-23  

**Standing rule:** every meaningful prompt → commit + push to `main` so Claude Code / Grok / Codex stay in sync. See `AGENTS.md`.

This file is the single source of truth for agents (Codex / GPT / Claude) cloning the app without chat context.

### Naming (do not confuse)

| Say this | Not this |
|----------|----------|
| **Wonder** — the product / workspace | Dr. Melani, notion-like |
| **Mel** — the coach / AI bubble | The whole app is not “Melani” |
| One app on **:5173** | Separate health app on :8781 |

Internal paths/keys may still contain `melani` so localStorage and imports keep working.

---

## App summary

Wonder is a **Notion-style personal OS** with health surfaces baked in (one app):

- Pages, blocks, slash commands, databases, sidebar
- Fitness: Sleep · Meals · Gym
- Cycle tracker, labs, hygiene restock (Amazon product pages)
- Mel: local life OS agent with real app tools (no API required)
- Optional bridges: Gmail IMAP (:8790), Grok AI (:8791)
- Nightly **body brief**: one report of the day from live localStorage data
- Mel **Digital Twin**: today scores, early radar, one lever, seven-day forecast, and clinic pack
- **Wardrobe**: upstream gallery/editor plus local garment perception, event-sourced closet state, explainable decision engine, and Mel actions under Agents

Data lives in the **browser** (`localStorage`). No backend DB required for core use.

---

## Exact startup commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/wonder.git
cd wonder
git checkout main
npm install
npm run dev
open -a Safari "http://127.0.0.1:5173/"
```

Open: **http://127.0.0.1:5173/** — that is Wonder (merged personal OS). Do not send users to a second app on :8781.

Optional bridges (not required for the UI):

```bash
# Mel AI bridge (reads XAI key from env or ~/.melani_assistant/xai_api_key)
npm run ai
# → http://127.0.0.1:8791

# Gmail IMAP bridge
npm run gmail
# → http://127.0.0.1:8790
```

Build check:

```bash
npm run build
```

Open it at `/?page=pg-fashion-os` or through **Agents → Wardrobe**. Upstream is
`https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/wardrobe` at commit
`f44006cce7e4779e595a35b25fbbc8dabc68d7e4`. Runtime records, images, local model,
operational state, and event ledger are in gitignored `data/`. The normal import
path is fully local and requires no key. `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`data/model-reference.png` are only for the retained optional modeled-image path.

### Health analysis

- **Labs:** `src/melani/labEngine.ts` + `labData.ts` (import/status/sections/blurbs)
- **Red flags / weekly rollup / doctor questions:** `src/melani/melContext.ts`
- **Nightly summary:** `src/melani/bodyBrief.ts` (write via Fitness card or Mel `brief`)

### Mel life OS agent

Mel runs locally first. Every command is parsed by `src/melani/melAgent.ts`, and
all state changes go through `src/melani/melTools.ts`. Grok is optional and may
improve the final wording, but it never owns the mutation. The tool result is the
source of truth.

Core tools:

- Live snapshot and status from the same stores used by Fitness, Meals, Sleep,
  Cycle, goals, pins, and life logs
- Write or refresh the nightly body brief
- Food plan, beef/salmon lock, and eaten state
- Log or undo the usual breakfast using `dr-melani-meals-usuals:YYYY-MM-DD`
- Log or undo water using the existing water total and history keys
- Log sleep hours, brain fog, and all supplements
- Set goals, pin/unpin facts, search logs, add life logs, and open pages
- Existing My Tasks/focus and Shopping actions remain reachable through Mel
- Create, open, list, rename, duplicate, move, favorite, clear, trash, and restore workspace pages
- Append or replace page text, with the last 20 Mel workspace changes available through `undo that`
- Chain up to 10 bounded actions in one request while carrying page context between steps
- Ask `what did you do`, `last action`, or `action history` for stored, truthful receipts
- Use the private Ollama `llama3:latest` model for natural conversation and fuzzy workspace intent when it is installed

Quick checks in the Mel panel:

```text
hi
what meat
beef
brief
log breakfast
drank 1L and ate breakfast
drank 1L and slept 7h and brain fog no and took all supplements
status
goal protein 130
open wardrobe
what should I wear for streaming
wear outfit 1
I liked outfit 1
plan my outfits for 7 days
should I buy an olive dress for $120
what should I buy next
fabric audit
should I buy polyester blend jeans
should I buy another gray Uniqlo sweatpant
tailor brief for black jeans
baggy only
create a page called Neurotech Ideas under Planning
rename this page to Research
add prototype notes to this page
create a page called Launch Plan under Planning, then add milestone one to this page, and favorite it
what did you do
undo that
```

Without an xAI key, all local tools above still work. If Ollama and
`llama3:latest` are available, Mel also uses that private on-device model for
open-ended replies and fuzzy workspace commands. For live web research and meal
image analysis, save an xAI key in `~/.melani_assistant/xai_api_key`, run
`npm run ai`, and keep the `npm run dev` process running. The local bridge
exposes `/api/melani-ai/chat`, `/api/melani-ai/research`, and
`/api/melani-ai/meal` through the Vite proxy.

Mel does not use OpenAI or an OpenAI key. Wardrobe's standard perception and
decision path is also local. A legacy provider path remains isolated for optional
modeled editorials, but no deterministic closet action depends on it.

### Nutrition tracking

- **Meals panel + usuals:** `src/melani/FitnessExact.tsx` (Meals tab)
- **Presets / macros / supplements:** `src/melani/data.ts`
- **localStorage keys:** `dr-melani-meals-usuals:YYYY-MM-DD`, `dr-melani-water-ml:YYYY-MM-DD`, `dr-melani-supplements-done:YYYY-MM-DD`

### Fridge safety

**Not a separate module in this branch.** Closest surfaces:

- Hygiene product restock + Amazon product links (`HygieneExact.tsx`, `productLinks.ts`)
- Meal logging (not inventory / expiry / fridge camera)

If Codex is looking for a dedicated “fridge safety” feature, it is **not in this tree** yet — do not invent files for it.

## Env vars

| Var | Required? | Used by |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| none | for core UI | Vite app only needs `npm run dev` |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | optional | `server/melani_ai.py` / `npm run ai` (or file `~/.melani_assistant/xai_api_key`) |
| Gmail email + App Password | optional | entered in UI → stored under bridge data dir, **not** in repo |
| `CARE_VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL` | optional | server-side Care Concierge outbound voice handoff |
| `CARE_VOICE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | optional | bearer secret sent only from the Vite server middleware |

**Never commit API keys.** None ship in this repository.

### Care Concierge

The Care Concierge agent lives in `src/melani/care/*` with its page in
`src/melani/CareConcierge.tsx`. It parses book, reschedule, cancel, and check
requests locally; keeps drafts distinct from approved/sent/confirmed states; and
records consent receipts. Browser speech recognition and the best installed
system voice provide the local conversation. `scripts/care-concierge-api.mjs`
is the guarded server-side adapter for an optional outbound voice provider.
Without that webhook, the UI truthfully remains in local mode and offers a
tap-to-call brief instead of pretending a call occurred.

## Known bugs / caveats

1. **GitHub repo `size` may show 0** on newly filled repos even when files exist — use `git clone` + branch, or API trees, not only the size field.
2. **Dot in repo name** (`dr.melani`) confuses some agents; always clone with the full URL and checkout this branch explicitly.
3. **TypeScript project has pre-existing unused-var warnings** in older files; `npm run build` may surface them — core app still runs under Vite dev.
4. **Amazon:** only real product URLs (`/dp/ASIN`) and full login; broken cart-add deep links were intentionally removed.
5. **Mel “AI” chat defaults to local rules** (`melLocal.ts`); cloud Grok needs `npm run ai` + key.
6. **No fridge-safety feature** in this branch (see above).
7. **Browser data is local** — cloning the repo does not copy the user’s sleep/meals history from another machine.

## Digital Twin

Twin is the forward-looking layer; Body Brief remains the nightly narrative of today.
It reads the existing sleep, nutrition, water, supplements, cycle, gym, lab, goals,
pins, and life-log stores. It does not create a parallel health database. Core Twin
logic is offline TypeScript and needs no environment variables.

- Fitness renders `TwinDashboard` above Body Brief.
- `writeTwin()` refreshes Body Brief and saves a rolling 30-day Twin history.
- Mel commands: `twin`, `digital twin`, `forecast`, `radar`, `lever`, `doctor pack`, `clinic`.
- Persistence: `dr-melani-twin-v1` and `dr-melani-twin-day:YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Forecasts are directional rules, not diagnoses or trained medical models.

## How agents should verify the branch

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/dr.melani.git 'refs/heads/grok/*'
git clone https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/dr.melani.git
cd dr.melani && git checkout grok/latest-dr-melani-july-21-2026
ls src/melani/bodyBrief.ts src/melani/NightlyBodyBrief.tsx package.json server/
npm install && npm run dev
```

Confirm files:

- `src/melani/bodyBrief.ts` exists  
- `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` exists  
- `README.md` has section **Codex handoff**

## Mirrors (same commit family)

- https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/notion-like  
- https://github.com/melanikshrestha-boop/dr-melani-health-app  

Prefer **`dr.melani` + this branch** for Codex handoff.
